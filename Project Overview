This project explores historical temperature data to understand long-term climate patterns.
It focuses on data cleaning, trend identification, and correlation analysis to provide insights into global temperature variations.

Key Features
1. Data Preprocessing:
-Converted the dt column to a proper datetime format.
-Handled missing values by removing records with null temperatures.
-Extracted yearly temperature trends for analysis.
2. Feature Engineering:
-Aggregated average global temperature per year for trend detection.
-Calculated moving averages to smooth temperature fluctuations.
3. Data Visualization:
-Line Plot: Displays global temperature trends over time.
-Heatmap: Shows correlations between temperature and uncertainty values.
-Moving Average Analysis: Helps detect long-term climate patterns.
